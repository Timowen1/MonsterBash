# MonsterBash
Third-person multiplayer game I have been working on for portfolio. 

This project is a continuation for my portfolio and I will add to this as I move along. 
Current game state:

~ Level:
  Village (arena) is blocked out for testing and will have added debug features later on
  Character animations setup but not set on character yet (I paused in between while working on other projects)
  Collisions set and blocking volumes are set (prevents character from going off far from village
  
~ Contents:
  The contents in the game are assets pulled from Unity Asset Store and not of my own wrok. They were made free 
  by the creators and I do not intend to sell this as licensed work. This project is purly made for my portfolio
  and for fun. Eventually the project will be made and ported to my website for peopple to play on.
  
  
~ TODO for now:
  Fix animator controlers to sync over net
  Set animations in scripts
  Rework the main GUI
  Add in the particle FX for each character
  Create attack template possibly from excel sheet
  Add scoreboard and point meter (eventually leaderboard will have values stored on a database that will run from my site)
